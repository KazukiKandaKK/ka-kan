  <h1>Hello, I'm an engineer</h1>

  <p>
    I'm interested in the interface between high-level abstraction and low-level systems.
    I often write about what many overlook‚Äîinternal implementations, OS behavior, memory layout, and boundary cases.

    <h2>üßë‚Äçüíª Profile</h2>
    <p>
      With approximately eight years of experience in software development, I specialize in bridging infrastructure, machine learning, and automation to improve system reliability and operational efficiency across diverse industries.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have contributed to foundational infrastructure projects in AWS environments, implementing recovery automation via Terraform and improving CI/CD pipelines by eliminating manual inefficiencies.
      My involvement in ISMS and PMS committees has also supported the successful alignment of operational frameworks with ISO27001 and ISO27017 standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      In machine learning, I have developed time-series analysis systems for contribution analysis and deployed real-time object detection solutions using CNNs and Transformers.
      These projects included full-cycle development‚Äîfrom data preparation to model tuning and evaluation‚Äîintegrated within MLOps pipelines both in cloud and on-premise environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work has extended to robotics and wireless communication, where I built edge computing solutions and AWS-integrated monitoring systems that enhanced field operation efficiency.
      Additionally, I have taught machine learning internally, fostering cross-functional understanding and capability building.
    </p>
    <p>
      I place high value on quiet precision over hype, and focus on building reliable, maintainable systems informed by hands-on operational insight and deep technical grounding.
    </p>
